# Entry strategies for city-based platforms
This is the simulation code for my dissertation paper 
In this paper, I build a theoretical framework to study the relative importance
of multiple factors on entry decision of city-based platforms with homogeneous
products. I find that besides high network effect, high switching cost, low market
size, and low post-entry market return could also lead to market concentration.
The equilibrium in the two-player static game implies that the multi-sided and
transaction efficiency property related to a platform-based market could make large
cities more attractive to the second mover than in a non-platformâ€“based market.
Then I extend the static game to a dynamic game. In addition to the findings in the
static game, the dynamic game allows for multiple entries under different timing;
it is also able to plot the expansion path of both players within the structure of
a platform-based market, and the conditions for a second mover to take over the
market leadership become more stringent. The capability of capturing the largest
city ahead of its rival competitor is crucial in winning the market leadership for both
players. If a second mover lost the opportunity of capturing the largest market, it
might have to raise a huge amount of money to overcome its disadvantage in the
later competition.
